# TheatreL33t

_Christmas assignment for COMP66 (2018), created by Akash Bhattacharya._

### Resources
This project is coded in Python 3, and uses the Flask library as the web framework. 

The Database used was [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/), a Graph DB. 

The website is hosted on a Google Cloud Platform instance, using an NGINX server.

### Usage
The .zip file contains all the Python source files, plus the templates used for rendering the HTML pages. The DB data is not included because this would exceed the file upload size limit.

### Location
The website is hosted on a Google Compute instance: [landing page](http://35.189.123.118/). To log in as admin, please visit the [admin login page](http://35.189.123.118/admin).
